CHAPTER 3. 

I learned a basic dart code tutorial by watching YouTube 
Dart is a programming language that Flutter uses to build mobile, web, and server apps. It’s fast, productive, and works really well for creating modern user interfaces. If you’ve used languages like C++, JavaScript, Dart will feel familiar. But even if you’re new, it’s easy to pick up.
In short, Dart is like the script of a play, and Flutter is the stage that performs it!

Reflection for My Portfolio

Setting up Flutter wasn’t just about installing software. It was about learning to prepare an environment where I could create something amazing. I’m excited to use this for my projects and grow my skills in mobile app development!
